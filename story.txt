Welcome to Sourish's story

Once upon a time there lived a plumber. He was very good at this job.
Some may even say, the best plumber there ever was.
  The plumber could fix anything. Regardless of how big or small the job was. The 
key to his exellence was due to has large, burly hands. They could grip any pipe or
twist any screw that needed to be twisted. 

This plumber dreamed of rescuing a princess and stopping a giant turtle.
 Unfortunately, a legal company found out about his dreams and decided to sue for copyright infringement.

The plumber was afraid he would lose the case, so while he was repairing a pipe one day, he crawled in the pipe. Finally, after climbing for a few hours, he found an exit. He found himself successfully entering another world, where there were a princesse and a giant turtle. Now he could realize his dream, and he didnâ€™t have to worry about being sued!
